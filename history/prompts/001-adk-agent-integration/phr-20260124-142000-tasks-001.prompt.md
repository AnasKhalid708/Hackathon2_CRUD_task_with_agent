## Prompt

Generate implementation tasks for the ADK Agent Task Management Integration feature.

Context:
- Spec and plan are ready
- Need to install dependencies, test agent, fix issues, add documentation
- Follow the implementation plan structure

## Response snapshot

Successfully generated tasks.md with 59 implementation tasks organized by user story:

**Task Organization**:
- Phase 1: Setup (6 tasks) - Dependency installation and configuration
- Phase 2: Foundational (8 tasks) - Core infrastructure blocking all stories
- Phase 3: User Story 1 - Natural Language Task Creation (6 tasks) - P1 MVP
- Phase 4: User Story 2 - Conversational Task Retrieval (6 tasks) - P2
- Phase 5: User Story 3 - Conversational Task Updates (7 tasks) - P3
- Phase 6: User Story 4 - Conversational Task Deletion (6 tasks) - P4
- Phase 7: User Story 5 - Agent Service Health Monitoring (6 tasks) - P2
- Phase 8: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns (14 tasks) - Testing and documentation

**Key Insights**:
- Backend code already exists (agent.py, routes/agent.py per plan.md)
- Primary focus: dependency installation, testing, verification, bug fixes
- Each user story is independently testable and deliverable
- 20 tasks marked [P] for parallel execution
- All tasks follow strict checklist format: `- [ ] [TaskID] [P?] [Story?] Description with file path`

**MVP Path**: T001-T006 (Setup) → T007-T014 (Foundational) → T015-T020 (User Story 1) = Natural language task creation

**Parallel Opportunities**: 
- Setup phase: All dependency installations (T001-T003)
- After Foundational: All 5 user stories can start in parallel
- Polish phase: Test creation (T046-T048) and documentation (T050-T051)

**Dependencies**:
- All user stories blocked by Foundational phase completion
- User stories are independent of each other after foundation
- Polish phase requires all desired stories complete

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: 59 implementation tasks generated with clear execution order, user story organization, and MVP path
- 🧪 Tests: Not applicable (documentation generation task)
- 📁 Files: Created specs/001-adk-agent-integration/tasks.md (433 lines)
- 🔁 Next prompts: Execute tasks starting with Phase 1 (Setup) to install dependencies
- 🧠 Reflection: Task structure correctly prioritizes existing code verification over new implementation. Focus on dependency installation (google-genai, google-adk), integration testing, and bug fixing aligns with plan.md which states backend code already exists. MVP scope well-defined as just User Story 1 for immediate value delivery.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - task generation successful
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Format validation: PASS (all tasks have checkbox, ID, description with file paths)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard task generation workflow per agent instructions
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): N/A - proceed with task execution
